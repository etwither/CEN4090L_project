Escape Artist is a simple game played to pass the time where you control your ship 
using w, a, s, d keys and try to reach the target without getting hit by the enemy spaceships.
After each level, the enemy spaceships speed increases making it harder to reach the target.
The target is also placed randomly on the other side of the map so that you have to use
different techniques to get past the enemy spaceships.The goal is to see if you can get the 
high score.
