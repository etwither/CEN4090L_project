		<center><body>Pokemon is a simple game based off the regular Pokemon series. Using the w, a, s, d keys, you can move a player around an environment with grass and water and encounter Pokemon.  You can catch these Pokemon with Pokemon balls and heal your Pokemon with pre-given items.  After collecting a certain amount of Pokemon, you will face a final boss. Beating this final boss will accomplish the final goal of the game.</body></center>
