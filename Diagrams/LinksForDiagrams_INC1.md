Sequence Diagrams (SD)

Chris said that our main paradigm would be the website and I don't **think** the website is going to use any classes, so we have to make
sequence diagrams for all of our use cases. Again, I tried my best here so obviously edit what you think should be changed/added whatever. Websites pretty easy to use but lmk if you need clarification for how it works. - KJ

Instructions and shit for the website: https://sequencediagram.org/instructions.html
LMK if you can't edit
