# Sequence Diagrams (SD)

Chris said that our main paradigm would be the website and I don't **think** the website is going to use any classes, so we have to make
sequence diagrams for all of our use cases. Again, I tried my best here so obviously edit what you think should be changed/added whatever.

Heres a google doc with all the TEXT versions of the diagrams:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PdfA77boz1yDZAtWzKKjSGAglM9W0E5GFB8q1o5p7A8/edit?usp=sharing

You can copy the corresponding texts for the diagrams (only 1 at a time) and paste it into https://sequencediagram.org/ to see what the diagram looks like. Make changes in the editor on the website. Any changes you make, update the google doc with the text so we can see real time updates (since website is kinda funky and doesn't do that).



OR y'all can just tell me what you want added/changed and I can do it myself w.e works - KJ

Instructions and shit for the website: https://sequencediagram.org/instructions.html
LMK if you can't edit
