# Sequence Diagrams (SD)

Chris said that our main paradigm would be the website and I don't **think** the website is going to use any classes, so we have to make
sequence diagrams for all of our use cases. Again, I tried my best here so obviously edit what you think should be changed/added whatever.

Note: I think websites kinda old school so it doesn't do real time updates (like google docs and stuff). So if you all DO make changes to any files, please export -> create link to share -> copy raw link (and find somewhere to shorten it if you want) -> update this file with the new link with version I guess

OR y'all can just tell me what you want added/changed and I can do it myself w.e works - KJ

Instructions and shit for the website: https://sequencediagram.org/instructions.html
